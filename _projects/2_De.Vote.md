**Problem Addressed**

De.Vote tackles the critical challenges in the current voting systems, including concerns about privacy, control, and the complexities of secure voting. The project aims to revolutionize voting processes by implementing a blockchain-based, decentralized approach, making voting more accessible, secure, and transparent.

**Personal Contributions**

My primary role in De.Vote involved leading the transformation of a theoretical blockchain-based voting scheme into a viable commercial solution. I spearheaded research with associations to identify voters' pain points and gaps in existing systems. My strategic approach in developing the web2 MVP was to simplify complex features, focusing on addressing users' concerns about privacy and security in a cost-effective manner. This strategy was crucial in validating the web3 attributes through a web2 system, subsequently leading to securing real industry orders and gaining recognition among the top 20 startups in the government's FITI (From IP to IPO) program. I contributed 35% of the development work, primarily in backend development.

**Solutions Developed & Impact**

The development of De.Vote involved a meticulous balance between usability and advanced security features. My leadership in the project led to the implementation of our services for industrial clients and the development of an innovative proxy voting method. This method effectively balanced usability with security, resulting in a patent in Taiwan. The impact of De.Vote is far-reaching, as it offers a practical, secure, and user-friendly solution to the challenges of traditional voting systems, ensuring greater participation and trust in the democratic process.

**Learning Outcomes & Reflections**

Working on De.Vote has been an invaluable learning experience in terms of understanding the intersection of technology, democracy, and user needs. It has enhanced my skills in blockchain technology, trust-computing, and strategic product development. The project underscored the importance of user-centric design in technology, especially in sensitive areas like voting. The success of De.Vote in gaining industry recognition and securing a patent is a testament to the power of innovative solutions in addressing real-world problems. It has also reinforced my belief in the potential of blockchain technology as a tool for enhancing transparency and trust in critical societal functions.
