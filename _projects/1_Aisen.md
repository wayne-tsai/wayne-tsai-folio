**Problem Addressed**

Aisen addresses the critical challenge of communication barriers faced by individuals with disabilities, specifically those who have lost their ability to speak or write due to conditions like Parkinson's disease. This project focuses on developing an affordable and accessible communication aid using gaze-tracking technology.

**Personal Contributions**

My role in Aisen began during my undergraduate studies, inspired by my personal experience with my grandfather's struggle with Parkinson's disease. I contributed my programming skills and expertise in Natural Language Processing (NLP) to develop an initial Minimal-Viable-Product (MVP). This MVP utilized a modified hardware gaming eye-tracker combined with PowerPoint. Over time, I evolved this into a sophisticated, web-based solution using webcam-driven, LLM-enhanced technologies, highlighting my commitment to continuous improvement and innovation. I contributed 50% of the development work in total and 100% of the paper writing.

**Solutions Developed & Impact**

Aisen evolved from a traditional eye-tracker with a basic web interface to a sophisticated, purely web-based application using the WebGazer.js library. This transition significantly enhanced the affordability and ease of software distribution. The “word card” system, specifically designed for Chinese character input, further tailored the solution to the complexities of different languages. The first trial's success, where Aisen helped my grandfather express a physical sensation accurately, underscored the project's potential and impact. This solution offers a cost-effective, accessible alternative to traditional assistive devices, empowering individuals with communication impairments to articulate their thoughts effectively.

**Learning Outcomes & Reflections**

Working on Aisen has been a transformative experience, reinforcing my passion for accessibility and technology's power to make a tangible difference in people's lives. This project honed my technical skills in programming, NLP, and web development, and also deepened my understanding of user-centered design and empathy in technology. The journey from an MVP to a refined product taught me the value of iterative development, user feedback, and the importance of making technology accessible and affordable. Aisen's success has been a testament to the idea that technological innovations can significantly improve quality of life, especially for those with special needs.
