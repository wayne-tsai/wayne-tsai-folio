News (formly known as NTHU eID): [https://smartcampus.site.nthu.edu.tw/p/404-1512-240744.php](https://smartcampus.site.nthu.edu.tw/p/404-1512-240744.php)

**Basic Information**
- Total Award Grant: US$4760
- Team Size: 1
- Duration: 12-Month
- Role: Solo Developer

**Problem Addressed**

The idLab eID project addresses the need for a more efficient, secure, and environmentally friendly identification system in educational and corporate settings. By advocating for the transition to paperless student IDs, the project aims to modernize identity verification processes using Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) and reduce the reliance on traditional, physical ID cards.

**Personal Contributions**

As the sole contributor to this project, I was responsible for every aspect of its development and implementation. My work involved introducing a dynamic QR code system, similar to those used in payment platforms, for authenticating student identities. This system was integrated with the backend server I developed, which connects to National Tsing Hua University's OAuth server. I also developed a verifier app as a Progressive Web App (PWA), ensuring it was user-friendly and accessible with an easily memorable domain, thereby eliminating the need for a separate app download and enhancing security against phishing attempts.

**Solutions Developed & Impact**

The idLab eID solution effectively reduces the reliance on physical IDs by implementing a dynamic QR code system for identity verification. The PWA verifier app streamlines the process for faculty, merchants, and others who need to verify student identities, making it more accessible and secure. The adoption of the prover-verifier model in various applications like attendance tracking and signature/verification systems showcases the versatility of the solution. The project not only simplifies identification processes but also enhances security and efficiency in organizational operations.

**Learning Outcomes & Reflections**

Working on idLab eID as a personal project allowed me to fully immerse myself in every stage of its development, from conception to implementation. This experience deepened my understanding of PKI, web development, and system integration. It highlighted the importance of user-centric design in technology solutions, especially in an educational context. The project reinforced my belief in the potential of technology to streamline everyday processes and enhance security. Seeing the practical applications of PKI in everyday life through this project was both fulfilling and inspiring.
