Hello! 👋 I'm a Software Engineer and Computer Science student specializing in distributed systems and full-stack development. With a strong foundation in backend architecture, I've built high-performance systems processing 500+ TPS and developed ML-powered applications that solve real-world challenges.

My technical journey includes architecting De.Vote's scalable voting platform using Ruby/Puma with multi-process workers, and developing Aisen's cost-effective eye-tracking solution using WebGazer.js and React. These projects showcase my expertise in:
• Distributed Systems & High-Performance Backend Architecture
• Full-Stack Development (Ruby, Python, JavaScript, React)
• Cloud Infrastructure & DevOps (AWS, Docker, Kubernetes)
• Machine Learning Integration & Real-Time Processing

Currently pursuing my MS in Technology Innovation at UW with a focus on Computer Science, I combine technical depth with entrepreneurial experience to build impactful software solutions. My work has been recognized through a granted patent, publications at ACM UIST, and national startup awards.
