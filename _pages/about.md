Hello!👋 I'm a student with a keen interest in development and entrepreneurship. I've had the opportunity to work at the intersection of technology, finance, and entrepreneurship. My entrepreneurial spirit led me to establish projects like De.Vote, a high-security voting system, and Aisen, an eye-tracking communication aid. Both initiatives have evolved into startups and have garnered recognition on both national and international platforms.

Driven by a passion for innovation and a commitment to creating impactful solutions, I continuously seek opportunities to learn and grow. Opportunities for further discussion or collaboration are always appreciated. 💻
