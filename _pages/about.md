Hello! 👋 I'm Wayne — a software engineer who ships production-grade ML and distributed systems. I love taking ambiguous problems, building scalable services, and hardening them for reliability. Most recently, as a Software Engineering Intern at Dareesoft, I modernized our hazard intelligence platform and delivered a GPU-accelerated spatial pipeline that slashed latency and unlocked richer data stories for city partners.

Previously, I co-founded De.Vote and Aisen Technology while completing my graduate and undergraduate studies. At De.Vote, I designed a Ruby/Puma voting platform that exceeds 500+ TPS, containerized the stack, and rolled out CI/CD for reliable production operations. At Aisen, I created a full-stack assistive-communication system powered by WebGazer.js, React, and AWS that replaced dedicated eye-trackers with commodity webcams—lowering deployment costs by 99%.

These roles sharpened my focus on:
<ul>
        <li>High-performance backend architecture and distributed systems</li>
        <li>Full-stack product delivery with Ruby, Python, JavaScript, and React</li>
        <li>Cloud infrastructure, DevOps, and MLOps across AWS, GCP, and Kubernetes</li>
        <li>Human-centered ML interfaces that translate research into impact</li>
    </ul>

I'm pursuing an MS in Technology Innovation (Computer Science) at the <a href='https://www.washington.edu'>University of Washington</a>, following a BSc in Computer Science & Quantitative Finance from National Tsing Hua University. My research and product work have led to publications at ACM UIST and the VLSI Design/CAD Symposium, along with a granted patent on privacy-preserving proxy voting.

When I'm not prototyping new ideas, you'll find me iterating on AI-assisted networking projects—like optimizing 5G router traffic—or exploring ways to translate research innovations into everyday tools. Let's connect about distributed systems, human-machine interfaces, or your next product challenge! 💻
